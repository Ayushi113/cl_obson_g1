                  <b>Description of the study</b><br>
                  Synthetic speech, like the voices of Alexa and Google Home, sound really good. In this study, we are exploring the human-likeness of this speech.<br>
                  <b><i>Your task: </i></b>You will hear audio stimuli, produced either by a human, or generated synthetically, by a computer.<br>
                  Your <i>main task</i> is to tell us whether it sounds like a HUMAN or a MACHINE. Then, we will also ask you how confident you feel about your decision (100% = fully confident, 0% = not at all confident)<br><br>

                  For further data analysis, we request the following information from you:<br>
                  a) your sex, <br>
