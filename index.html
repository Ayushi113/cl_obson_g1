<br>Email: pandeya@tcd.ie<br><br><b>Description of the study</b><br>Synthetic speech, like the voices of Alexa and Google Home, sound really good. In this study, we are exploring the human-likeness of this speech. <br><b><i>Your task: </i></b>You will hear audio stimuli, produced either by a human, or generated synthetically, by a computer. <br>Your <i>main task</i> is to tell us whether it sounds like a HUMAN or a MACHINE. Then, we will also ask you how confident you feel about your decision (100% = fully confident, 0% = not at all confident)<br><br>For further data analysis, we request the following information from you:&nbsp; <br>a) your sex, <br>b) your age, <br>c) your English proficiency, <br>e) your hearing ability,<br>f) the hardware you are using to listen to the speech samples. <br><br>All other identifying information will be deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>After filling out the questionnaire, you will start the subjective evaluation. <br><br><b>Time required<br></b>The protocol is designed to last around 25 minutes but no more than 45 minutes.
<br><br><b>Confidentiality</b><br>Your identity will be kept confidential. If signed by you, this consent form will be kept locked
separately from the data we collect during the experiment. It will not be possible to link the
data we collect to your name. The data we collect will constitute a dataset dedicated to the
analysis of synthetic speech. Your data will be analysed with the data collected from other
participants, and generalised results and conclusions drawn from these experiments will be
submitted for publication at conferences and/or scientific journals. Your name will never be used
in any report or article.<br><br><b>Declaration</b><br>• I am 18 years or older and am competent to provide consent.
